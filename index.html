  <br>
  <p class="text-center">The NSA website is a one-stop shop for people to find all the information they need on the National Security Agency. The NSA specializes in cybersecurity and cryptologic data for the United States. The primary goal of this project was to polish the NSA's user interface to create a more delightful design.</p>

        <br>
        <p>
          I worked on a team of three people. We were responsible for creating an individual redesign, but we collaborated on various aspects of the project together. The parts of the project we collaborated on were the proto persona, annotations, competitor analysis, and heuristic evaluation.</p>

        <br>
        <p>We used Figma, Google Presentations, and Trello for the NSA redesign.</p>

      <br>
      <p>The project took place over six weeks. We worked in a group of three for the first three weeks, and then the next three weeks were individual. We did not have a budget for our user research or user testing. We did this project with no financial sponsorship.</p>

      <h1 class="text-decoration-underline">The Problem Through William Benson's Eyes</h1>
      <br>
      <p>We came up with our user persona- William Benson. William is a recent college graduate looking to start a career with the NSA. William needs to find clear information about the NSA and how to get a job there. The problem is the current NSA website navigation is unclear. William needs a simple and easy-to-use website to find the information he needs to start a career with the NSA.</p>

  <h1 class="text-decoration-underline">Research and Analysis</h1>
  <br>
  <p>We began our user research by conducting tests on the NSA's original website to see what users liked and disliked about the website. Our user testing plan sought to discover how we could improve the NSA's user interface and the NSA's target users. We synthesized this data by taking notes on our user testing plan while we conducted our user tests. We interviewed friends and family to find out their opinions on the matter. We discovered the User Interface was missing simplistic design and LATCH Principals.</p>

  <br>
  <h>The NSA redesign needed a minimalistic design to make William's goals easily achievable.</h>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>1. Incorporate Grid Systems and LATCH Principals</p>
  <p>2. Make the main goals of the website: 'Contact Us' and 'Careers' easily visible.</p>
  <p>3. Recategorize the content of the website to avoid user confusion</p>

<h1>I developed a Mood-board, and turned that Mood-board into a Style Guide</h1>
<br>
<p>I had to change the NSA theme from spacey and green to something closer to their actual theme of patriotism, strength, and security. I started designing a mood board to get me thinking of how I would make these changes. I then tailored this mood board to my buttons, iconography, and prototype designs. In this case, the tailoring tool was the UI Style Guide. The mood board, UI Style Guide, and Guerrilla User tests brought me to my final design. </p>

<h1 class="text-decoration-underline">Iterating the Original NSA Design and my Design</h1>
<p>One of the findings from the User Tests was that the NSA interface did not make users feel like they were on a government website. The colors, typography, and images made users feel like they were visiting an environmental or space website, not a technological defense website. The green and purple coloring with the chosen font made users feel "like they were on a space mission" instead of feeling like they were viewing our country's cybersecurity sector. </p>
<p> I began doing User Tests on my design. My findings were I needed to eliminate excess white space, add hover interactions to my components on the desktop prototype, and add a home icon. The home icon allowed users to click the NSA logo to get home and get home with the home icon. </p>

<h1 class="text-decoration-underline">It wasnâ€™t a perfect process, but I learned a lot about design</h1>
<p>Did I have to go back and fix the components? Yes. Did it pain me to hear some of the feedback? Of course. In the end, it was worth it. If I had not added hover interactions/animations, iterated on the use of my white space, and stuck with my original design, I would not have the design I'm proud of today. This case taught me that you can take any design and make it more appealing, no matter what boring subject. </p>
