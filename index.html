  <h1 class="text-center">Giving the NSA a more Delightful Design</h1>
  <p class="text-center">The NSA website is a one-stop shop for people to find all the information they need on the National Security Agency. The NSA specializes in cybersecurity and cryptologic data for the United States. The primary goal of this project was to polish the NSA's user interface to create a more delightful design.</p>

        <h>Roles/Teams</h>
        <p>I worked on a team of three people. We were responsible for creating an individual redesign, but we collaborated on various aspects of the project together. The parts of the project we collaborated on were the proto persona, annotations, competitor analysis, and heuristic evaluation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <h>Tools</h>
        <p>We used Figma, Google Presentations, and Trello for the NSA redesign.</p>

      <h>Client/Date/Duration</h>
      <p>The project took place over six weeks. We worked in a group of three for the first three weeks, and then the next three weeks were individual. We did not have a budget for our user research or user testing. We did this project with no financial sponsorship.</p>

      <h1>The Problem Through William Benson's Eyes</h1>
      <p>We came up with our user persona- William Benson. William is a recent college graduate looking to start a career with the NSA. William needs to find clear information about the NSA and how to get a job there. The problem is the current NSA website navigation is unclear. William needs a simple and easy-to-use website to find the information he needs to start a career with the NSA.</p>

  <h1>Research and Analysis</h1>
  <p>We began our user research by conducting tests on the NSA's original website to see what users liked and disliked about the website. Our user testing plan sought to discover how we could improve the NSA's user interface and the NSA's target users. We synthesized this data by taking notes on our user testing plan while we conducted our user tests. We interviewed friends and family to find out their opinions on the matter. We discovered the User Interface was missing simplistic design and LATCH Principals.</p>

  <h1>User Path</h1>
  <p>We validated our research by mapping the current NSA Website's User Path. </p>

  <h1>Goals</h1>
  <h>The NSA redesign needed a minimalistic design to make William's goals easily achievable.</h>
  <p>Incorporate Grid Systems and LATCH Principals

    Make the main goals of the website: 'Contact Us' and 'Careers' easily visible
    
    Recategorize the content of the website to avoid user confusion</p>
